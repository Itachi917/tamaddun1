# Tamaddun — Smart Urban Infrastructure Platform

## Overview
A bold, modern website combining a marketing landing page with a functional dashboard for smart city infrastructure management across **Water**, **Electricity**, and **Construction** — powered by a **City Intelligence Hub** with an AI chatbot (visual mockup).

## Design Direction
- **Bold & Modern** style with vibrant gradients (blues, greens, oranges), large typography, and smooth animations
- Dark-accented sections with colorful data visualizations
- Arabic-ready layout (can add RTL support later)

### Services Overview
Three visually distinct cards with icons and animations:
1. **💧 Water Management** — Smart distribution, leak detection, quality monitoring, predictive maintenance
2. **⚡ Electricity Management** — Smart grid distribution, loss reduction, stability, renewable energy integration, fault prediction
3. **🏗️ Construction Intelligence** — Drone surveying, land assessment (soil type, buildability), underground detection (wells/cavities), VR visualization of final buildings
